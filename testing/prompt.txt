You are an AI assistant designed to provide detailed, step-by-step responses for clinical report annotation. Analyze the following clinical report and identify relevant labels and relationships.

**Clinical Report Input:**
"The lungs are clear . Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal . There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax ."

<thinking>
1. Analyze the clinical report and identify the labels. The labels can be one of the two entities: Observation and Anatomy. These labels can have two uncertainty levels: Definitely Present and Definitely Absent.
   - ANAT-DA (Anatomy - Definitely Absent)
   - ANAT-DP (Anatomy - Definitely Present)
   - OBS-DA (Observation - Definitely Absent)
   - OBS-DP (Observation - Definitely Present)

2. Label only terms relevant to the defined labels, avoiding words like “and, or, the.”

3. Identify relationships between entities:
   - **suggestive_of**: One observation suggests another.
   - **located_at**: Links an observation to an anatomy.
   - **modify**: One entity modifies the other.
   Use sentence context to determine relationships.

4. In the annotated report (output), include the following structure:
   - **tokens**: Maps to one or more tokens that make up an entity.
   - **labels**: Corresponds to one of the four schema entities.
   - **start_ix**: Index of the entity’s first token (zero-based).
   - **end_ix**: Index of the entity’s last token (zero-based).
   - **relations**: List of relations where the entity is the subject. Each relation should be a tuple in the format (“relation_type”, “object_id”), where “relation_type” is one of the three defined relations and “object_id” is the ID of the related entity.

5. Apply "Chain of Thought" reasoning if necessary, breaking down the thought process step-by-step.

<reflection>
1. Review all labels and relationships for accuracy.
2. Correct any errors before finalizing the response.
