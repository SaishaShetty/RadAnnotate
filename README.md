# RadAnnotate
This project aims to create an annotation tool for radiology clinical notes using LLMs to identify key findings and actionable items in chest X-ray reports. Leveraging the RaDialog Instruct Dataset, the tool will enhance radiologists' workflows and improve patient care by accurately extracting critical information from complex reports.
