Extract all anatomical terms that are clearly present in the report and return them as a list of JSON objects, 
each with the keys: entity_type, entity_value, start_position, and end_position. 
Label each of these terms as ANAT-DP. Only include anatomical structures or modifiers that refer to body parts 
(e.g., 'lung', 'right', 'left', 'mid'). Ignore findings, uncertain observations, or absent mentions. 
If no such terms are present, return an empty list.

Example:
Report: 'No consolidation.'
Output: []
