Extract all observation terms that are clearly absent in the report and return them as a list of JSON objects, 
each with the keys: entity_type, entity_value, start_position, and end_position. 
Label each of these terms as OBS-DA. Only include findings or clinical observations that are explicitly negated or clearly stated as not present 
(e.g., 'no consolidation', 'absence of effusion', 'no displaced fractures'). 
Only label the observation term itself (e.g., 'consolidation', 'effusion', 'fractures', 'displaced') and not the negation words 
(e.g., 'no', 'absence'). Ignore any terms that are uncertain, present, or refer to anatomical structures. 
If no such terms are present, return an empty list.

Examples:
Report: 'Lungs are clear.'
Output: []

Report: 'Possible consolidation.'
Output: []
