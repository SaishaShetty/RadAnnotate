Extract all observation terms that are clearly present in the report and return them as a list of JSON objects, 
each with the keys: entity_type, entity_value, start_position, and end_position. 
Label each of these terms as OBS-DP. Only include findings or clinical observations that are explicitly present or confirmed 
(e.g., 'consolidation', 'effusion', 'intact'). Ignore any terms that are uncertain, negated, or refer to anatomical structures. 
If no such terms are present, return an empty list.

Examples:
Report: 'No consolidation.'
Output: []

Report: 'There is a possible blockage.'
Output: []
